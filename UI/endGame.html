        Obviously there are still a lot of things to be taken care of.
        Keep in mind that this is not the final version of the game.
        It is a demo project primarily targeted at potential recruiters.
        Its purpose is to showcase software devlopment skills.
        For that reason I haven't considered things like security, cookies, leaderboards, or back-end of any kind.
        I appreciate all the feedback, both positive or negative. It helps point out the things I have missed during
        initial development.
