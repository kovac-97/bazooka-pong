Overview

This is a personal game development project undertaken to improve my JavaScript and general programming skills. It's a non-commercial endeavor aimed at showcasing various features that JavaScript has to offer, including multithreading, events, object oriented programming, Promises, and functional programming. I attempted to make the code as modular as possible and use good software development practices, however other projects await so you can expect some bugs. 

In addition to the primary purpose of this being a portfolio, I hope it will provide some insight into JavaScript and game development in general to anyone who is in the process of studying it. I followed some MDN tutorials and decided to get a bit creative. Be sure to check those out if you are just starting: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Introduction

JavaScript Features

    Multithreading: Parallelization of arbitrary tasks using WebWorkers.
    Events: Used them to avoid complex logic implementation.
    Classes: While they are rare in regular JavaScript, they prove useful when working on large projects such as game development.
    Promises: Used promises to achieve await capability with WebWorkers.
    Functional Programming: Used some functional programming to make code more readable.
